## Quote Generator

First Complete Front-End Project I've ever built! Purpose was to practice building with HTML, CSS, JS and React. Also to teach myself how to work with APIs. Visit the project [Here](https://alec-huang-labs.github.io/RandomQuotes/)!

When the Twitter button is pressed, user will be directed to twitter where the tweet will be pre-populated with the text and author of the quote.
